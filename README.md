# HCard Builder

This is a front end code for creating hCards. It is written in ReactJS, using props and states.

## Running the app
To run the application, after downloading run:

npm install

npm start

npm test (I've included some basic snapshot tests)

## Structure of the Components. 
I organised my components by feature. So the top-level components are either components you can reuse or components that are just one-off. In time if we notice that we are reusing some of the sub-components, we may want to refactor it to the top-level.
